Hello, I am Shubham 

I currently work as a Data Scientist at [InsightFactory.ai](https://insightfactory.ai/). I specialize in building and deploying machine learning models. I possess a strong command of the full data science pipeline, from data preparation and feature engineering to model deployment and management.  My toolkit includes PySpark, SQL, Pandas, MLflow, Python, Azure, Databricks, and Power BI.

I received my M.Sc. in Data Science from the University of Adelaide in 2021. I also have Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering.
